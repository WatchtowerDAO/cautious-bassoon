# ♻️ Tournament Lifecycle

In this section we define the interactions occuring in the tournament and the overall state transitions/changes occuring during the lifecycle of the Dora data science tournaments and by extension in the broader Watchtower ecosystem.

# Creation Phase


# Initialisation Phase


# Execution Phase


# Settlement Phase



> _**Please Note** that there will be a couple other phases in between Execution and Settlement to account for programmatic Dispute Resolution. For the current version, settlement is rather a simple stake-weighted aggregation of risk and the subsequent threshold. These phases will be implemented with the inclusion of the data oracle (Laika) to transition tournaments more real-time._
